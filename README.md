# Takeaway Challenge

## What is it?
Takeaway challenge is a command line app that allows a user to order take away for a pizza restaurant. They can have a look at the menu, chose the items that they want, and see the total that they will have to pay for the order.

Once the order is confirmed, the user will get a text to confirm, including their expected delivery time.

### How to Use:
As this is a command line app, clone the repo, then open the directory in your command line.

### File Manifest:
The main files that you will need the items in the 'lib' folder. This includes:
* menu.rb
* order.rb

### My approach to this Challenge
I used TDD and OOD to design and create this program.

## How to Test:
To test this program, please use rspec. Note that this will run both unit tests (menu_spec.rb and order_spec.rb) and also feature tests (user_stories_spec_rb).
